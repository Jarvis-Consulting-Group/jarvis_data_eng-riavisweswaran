# Introduction
- Structured retailer data was analyzed using data wrangling and OLAP methodologies to generate statistical insights for a prospective marketing team. Customers were segmented into RFM categories utilizing Python Pandas and SQL querying. The analysis was performed within a Python Jupyter notebook, incorporating common visualizations to effectively illustrate trends and patterns in the data. This comprehensive analysis serves as a valuable resource for the marketing team, offering actionable insight for targeted marketing strategies and informed decision-making processes.
