summary: As a recent Finance and Economics graduate from Wilfrid Laurier University, I have taken several courses in RDBMS and developed a keen interest in business systems analysis. My internships have led across broad spheres of the fintech space, starting at a venture capital firm where I networked with founders of start-up technology companies, documented their processes and leveraged Python APIs to streamline data entry. At CGI, I liaised between clients, SMEs and implementation teams for requirements elicitation and to ensure that SLAs were being met. Additionally, I am proud to be the founder of several charity initiatives that have raised funds for the Down Syndrome Association of Toronto and the Arthritis Society of Canada. I am excited to bring my dynamic leadership experience, collaborative skills and technical experience to a full-time business systems analyst role.
